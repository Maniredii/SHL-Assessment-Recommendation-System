# SHL Assessment Recommendation System - Solution Approach

## Project Overview
A web-based RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) tool that recommends SHL assessments based on user queries or job descriptions.

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend (React.js)
- Single-page application with a clean, user-friendly interface
- Real-time query processing and results display
- Built with React.js for dynamic UI updates
- Deployed on Vercel for reliable hosting

### Backend (Node.js)
- RESTful API architecture
- Endpoint: `/api/recommend` for assessment recommendations
- Natural language processing for query understanding
- JSON response format for structured data

## Implementation Details

### 1. Query Processing
- User inputs natural language query or job description
- Frontend validates and sends POST request to backend
- Real-time status updates during processing

### 2. Assessment Matching
- Backend processes query using NLP techniques
- Matches query against assessment database
- Returns relevant recommendations in JSON format

### 3. Response Handling
- Frontend displays matched assessments
- Error handling for failed requests
- Backend status monitoring

## Implementation Status

### Local Development (Offline)
- ✅ Frontend and Backend communication working perfectly
- ✅ Successful query processing and recommendations
- ✅ Example of working local implementation:

  ![Local Results](Screenshot%20(51).png)

### Deployment Challenges
- ⚠️ Frontend-Backend connection issues after deployment
- ⚠️ CORS and API connectivity challenges
- ⚠️ Error handling implemented for better user experience
- 🔄 Working on resolving deployment-specific issues

### Current Status
- Local environment: Fully functional with all features
- Deployed version: Experiencing connection issues between frontend and backend
- Added status indicators and links for transparency
- Implemented error messages to guide users

## Technologies Used
- Frontend: React.js, Axios, CSS3
- Backend: Node.js, Express
- Deployment: Vercel
- Version Control: Git/GitHub

## Project Links

### Live Deployments
- Frontend Application: https://shl-assessment-nine.vercel.app/
- Backend API: https://shl-assessmentss.vercel.app/

### Source Code Repositories
- Complete Project: https://github.com/Maniredii/SHL-Assessment-Recommendation-System.git
- Frontend Repository: https://github.com/Maniredii/shl-assessment-frontend.git
- Backend Repository: https://github.com/Maniredii/shl-assessment-backend.git

## Future Improvements
- Enhanced error handling
- Caching for frequent queries
- Advanced filtering options
- User feedback integration
- Resolve deployment connectivity issues
- Implement better CORS handling
