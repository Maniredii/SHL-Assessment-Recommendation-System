# SHL Test Recommender - Solution Approach

## Problem Statement
Create a system that recommends appropriate SHL tests based on job descriptions or search queries, helping users identify the most relevant assessments for their hiring needs.

## Technical Architecture

### Backend (Python/Flask)
1. **Data Structure**
   - Maintained a comprehensive database of SHL tests with:
     - Test names and descriptions
     - Keywords for matching
     - Features (remote testing, adaptive IRT)
     - URLs to product catalog

2. **Recommendation Engine**
   - Implemented a scoring algorithm that:
     - Performs keyword matching (50% weight)
     - Analyzes description context (30% weight)
     - Considers test name relevance (20% weight)
   - Uses natural language processing for text cleaning and matching
   - Supports both direct queries and URL-based job descriptions

3. **API Design**
   - RESTful endpoint `/recommend`
   - Accepts both text queries and URLs
   - Returns JSON responses with ranked recommendations
   - Implements CORS for cross-origin requests
   - Includes comprehensive error handling

### Frontend (React)
1. **User Interface**
   - Clean, modern Material-UI design
   - Dual input options:
     - Direct text query
     - Job description URL
   - Real-time validation and feedback

2. **Results Display**
   - Card-based layout for recommendations
   - Shows test details, features, and relevance
   - Interactive elements for additional information
   - Direct links to SHL product catalog

## Key Features Implemented

1. **Search Functionality**
   - Natural language query processing
   - URL content extraction and analysis
   - Relevance scoring and ranking

2. **User Experience**
   - Responsive design
   - Loading states and error handling
   - Clear feedback messages
   - Intuitive navigation

3. **Integration**
   - Frontend-Backend communication via REST API
   - CORS handling for security
   - Environment-based configuration

## Technical Decisions

1. **Technology Stack**
   - Backend: Flask (Python) for rapid development and ML capabilities
   - Frontend: React with Material-UI for modern, responsive design
   - Deployment: Vercel (frontend) and Render (backend) for reliability

2. **Algorithm Design**
   - Weighted scoring system for accurate recommendations
   - Text preprocessing for better matching
   - Modular code structure for maintainability

3. **Security Considerations**
   - Input validation
   - CORS configuration
   - Error handling and logging

## Deployment Strategy
1. **Frontend**
   - Deployed on Vercel
   - Environment-based configuration
   - Automated builds and deployments

2. **Backend**
   - Deployed on Render
   - Python runtime configuration
   - Automatic scaling capabilities

## Future Improvements
1. Machine learning for better matching
2. User feedback integration
3. Caching for performance optimization
4. Additional test metadata and filtering options
5. Analytics for usage tracking

## Performance Considerations
- Optimized API response times
- Efficient text processing
- Scalable architecture
- Error recovery mechanisms
